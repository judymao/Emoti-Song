###"I'm A Believer"###

I thought love was
Only true in fairy tales
Meant for someone else
But not for me

Love was out to get me
That's the way it seems
Disappointment haunted
All my dreams

And then I saw her face
Now I'm a believer
And not a trace
Of doubt in my mind

I'm in love
I'm a believer
I couldn't leave her
If I tried

I thought love was more or less a given thing
But the more I gave the less I got, oh yeah

What's the use in trying?
All you get is pain
When I wanted sunshine
I got rain

And then I saw her face
Now I'm a believer
And not a trace
Of doubt in my mind

I'm in love
I'm a believer
I couldn't leave her
If I tried

What's the use in trying?
All you get is pain
When I wanted sunshine
I got rain

And then I saw her face
Now I'm a believer
Not a trace
Of doubt in my mind

I'm in love
I'm a believer
I couldn't leave her
If I tried

Then I saw her face
Now I'm a believer
Not a trace
Of doubt in my mind

Now I'm a believer
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

Now I'm a believer
Then I saw her face

Now I'm a believer
Not a trace
Of doubt in my mind
I'm a believer
Now I'm a believer

###"Chicken Fried"###

You know I like my chicken fried
And cold beer on a Friday night
A pair of jeans that fit just right
And the radio up

Well I was raised up beneath the shade of a Georgia Pine
And that's home you know
Sweet tea, pecan pie, and homemade wine
Where the peaches grow
And my house it's not much to talk about
But it's filled with love that's grown in southern ground

And a little bit of chicken fried
Cold beer on a Friday night
A pair of jeans that fit just right
And the radio up
I love to see the sun rise
See the love in my woman's eyes
Feel the touch of a precious child
And know a mother's love

It's funny how it's the little things in life
That mean the most
Not where you live, what you drive
Or the price tag on your clothes

There's no dollar sign
On a peace of mind
This I've come to know
So if you agree
Have a drink with me
Raise your glasses for a toast

To a little bit of chicken fried
And cold beer on a Friday night
A pair of jeans that fit just right
And the radio up
I love to see the sun rise
See the love in my woman's eyes
Feel the touch of a precious child
And know a mother's love

I thank God for my life
And for the stars and stripes
May freedom forever fly
Let it ring
Salute the ones who died
The ones that give their lives
So we don't have to sacrifice
All the things we love

Like our chicken fried
And cold beer on a Friday night
A pair of jeans that fit just right
And the radio up
I love to see the sun rise
See the love in my woman's eyes
Feel the touch of a precious child
And know a mother's love

Get a little chicken fried
And cold beer on a Friday night
A pair of jeans that fit just right
And the radio up
I love to see the sun rise
See the love in my woman's eyes
Feel the touch of a precious child
And know a mother's love

###"Why Don't We Just Dance"###

Baby why don't we just turn that TV off?
Three hundred fifteen channels
Of nothing but bad news on
Well, it might be me, but the way I see it
The whole wide world has gone crazy
So baby, why don't we just dance?

Guess the little bitty living room ain't gonna look like much
When the lights go down and we move the couch
It's gonna be more than enough
For my two left feet and our two hearts beatin'
Nobody's gonna see us go crazy
So baby, why don't we just dance?

Down the hall, maybe straight up the stairs
Bouncin' off the wall, floatin' on air
Baby, why don't we just dance?

Baby, why don't you go put your best dress on?
Those high heeled shoes you love to lose
As soon as the tunes come on
On second thought, just the way you are
Is already drivin' me crazy
So baby, why don't we just dance?

Down the hall, maybe straight up the stairs
Bouncin' off the wall, floatin' on air
Baby, why don't we just dance?
I'll cut a rug

Well it might be me but the way I see it
The whole wide world has gone crazy
So baby, why don't we just dance?
Oh baby, why don't we just dance?

###"It's A Great Day To Be Alive"###

I got rice cookin' in the microwave
Got a three day beard I don't plan to shave
And it's a goofy thing but I just gotta say, hey
I'm doin' alright

Yeah I think I'll make me some homemade soup
I'm feelin' pretty good and that's the truth
It's neither drink nor drug induced, no
I'm just doin' alright

And it's a great day to be alive
I know the sun's still shinin'when I close my eyes
There's some hard times in the neighborhood
But why can't everyday be just this good

It's been 15 years since I left home
And said good luck to every seed I'd sown
Gave it my best and then I left it alone
I hope they're doin' alright

Now I look in the mirror and what do I see
A lone wolf there starin' back at me
Long in the tooth but harmless as can be
Lord I guess he's doin' alright

And it's a great day to be alive
I know the sun's still shinin' when I close my eyes
There's some hard times in the neighborhood
But why can't everyday be just this good

Sometimes it's lonely, sometimes it's only me
And the shadows that fill this room
Sometimes I'm fallin', desperately callin'
Howlin' at the moon, ah-ooh

Well I might go get me a new tattoo
Or take my old Harley for a three day cruise
Might even grow me a Fu Manchu

And it's a great day to be alive
I know the sun's still shinin' when I close my eyes
There's some hard times in the neighborhood
But why can't everyday be just this good

It's a great day to be alive
I know the sun's still shinin' when I close my eyes
There's some hard times in the neighborhood
But why can't everyday be just this good

###"Joy To The World"###

Jeremiah was a bull frog
Was a good friend of mine
I never understood a single word he said
But I helped him drink his wine
And he always had some mighty fine wine

Singin'
Joy to the world
All the boys and girls, now
Joy to the fishes in the deep blue sea
Joy to you and me

If I were the king of the world
Tell you what I'd do
I'd throw away the cars and the bars and the wars
Make sweet love to you

Singin' now
Joy to the world
All the boys and girls
Joy to the fishes in the deep blue sea
Joy to you and me

You know I love the ladies
Love to have my fun
I'm a high night flier and a rainbow rider
A straight-shootin' son of a gun
I said a straight shootin' son of a gun

Joy to the world
All the boys and girls
Joy to the fishes in the deep blue sea 
Joy to you and me

Joy to the world
All the boys and girls
Joy to the fishes in the deep blue sea
Joy to you and me

Joy to the world
All the boys and girls
Joy to the world
Joy to you and me

Joy to the world
All the boys and girls, now
Joy to the fishes in the deep blue sea
Joy to you and me

Joy to the world
All the boys and girls
Joy to the fishes in the deep blue sea
Joy to you and me

###"What A Wonderful World"###

I see trees of green
Red roses too
I see them bloom
For me and you
And I think to myself
What a wonderful world

I see skies of blue
And clouds of white
The bright blessed day
The dark sacred night
And I think to myself
What a wonderful world

The colors of the rainbow
So pretty in the sky
Are also on the faces
Of people going by
I see friends shaking hands
Saying, "How do you do?"
They're really saying
"I love you"

I hear babies cry
I watch them grow
They'll learn much more
Than I'll never know
And I think to myself
What a wonderful world

Yes, I think to myself
What a wonderful world

Oh yeah

###"You're My Best Friend"###

Ooh, you make me live
Whatever this world can give to me
It's you, you're all I see
Ooh, you make me live now honey
Ooh, you make me live

You're the best friend

###"Back In The High Life Again"###

It used to seem to me
That my life ran on too fast
And I had to take it slowly
Just to make the good parts last
But when you're born to run
It's so hard to just slow down
So don't be surprised to see me
Back in that bright part of town

I'll be back in the high life again
All the doors I closed one time will open up again
I'll be back in the high life again
All the eyes that watched me once will smile and take me in

And I'll drink and dance with one hand free
Let the world back into me
And on I'll be a sight to see
Back in the high life again

You used to be the best
To make life be life to me
And I hope that you're still out there
And you're like you used to be
We'll have ourselves a time
And we'll dance 'til the morning sun
And we'll let the good times come in
And we won't stop 'til we're done

We'll be back in the high life again
All the doors I closed one time will open up again
We'll be back in the high life again
All the eyes that watched us once will smile and take us in
And we'll drink and dance with one hand free
And have the world so easily
And oh we'll be a sight to see
Back in the high life again

###"Keep Your Head Up"###

I've been waiting on the sunset
Bills on my mindset
I can't deny they're getting high
Higher than my income
Income's bread crumbs
I've been trying to survive

The glow that the sun gets
Right around sunset
Helps me realize
That this is just a journey
Drop your worries
You are gonna turn out fine.
Oh, you turn out fine.
Fine, oh, you turn out fine.

But you gotta keep your head up, oh,
And you can let your hair down, eh.
You gotta keep your head up, oh,
And you can let your hair down, eh.

I know it's hard, know it's hard
To remember sometimes,
But you gotta keep your head up, oh,
And you can let your hair down, eh.

I got my hands in my pockets,
Kicking these rocks.
It's kinda hard to watch this life go by.
I'm buying into skeptics,
Skeptics mess with
The confidence in my eyes

I'm seeing all the angles
Thoughts get tangled
I start to compromise
My life and my purpose.
Is it all worth it?
Am I gonna turn out fine?
Oh, you turn out fine.
Fine, oh, you turn out fine.

But you gotta keep your head up, oh,
And you can let your hair down, eh.
You gotta keep your head up, oh,
And you can let your hair down, eh.

I know it's hard, know it's hard,
To remember sometimes,
But you gotta keep your head up, oh,
And you can let your hair down, eh.

Only rainbows after rain
The sun will always come again.
And it's a circle, circling,
Around again, it comes around again.
I said,

Only rainbows after rain
The sun will always come again.
And it's a circle, circling,
Around again, it comes around,

But you gotta keep your head up, oh,
And you can let your hair down, eh.
You gotta keep your head up, oh,
And you can let your hair down, eh.

I know it's hard, know it's hard
To remember sometimes,
But you gotta keep your head up, oh,
And you can let your hair down, eh.

And keep your head up, oh,
And you can let your hair down, eh.
And keep your head up, oh,
And you can let your hair down, eh.
And keep your head up, oh,
And you can let your hair down.
I said oh, no, no, no, no, no

###"I Can See Clearly Now"###

I can see clearly now, the rain has gone
I can see all obstacles in my way
Gone are the dark clouds that had me blind
It's gonna be a bright, bright sun-shining day
It's gonna be a bright, bright sun-shining day

I think I can make it now, the pain has gone
All of the bad feelings have disappeared
Here is that rainbow I've been praying for
It's gonna be a bright, bright sun-shining day

Look all around, there's nothing but blue sky
Look straight ahead, nothing but blue sky

I can see clearly now, the rain has gone
I can see all obstacles in my way
Gone're the dark clouds that had me blind
It's gonna be a bright, bright sun-shining day
It's gonna be a bright, bright sun-shining day
Gonna be a bright, bright sun-shining day
Gonna be a bright, bright, bright sun-shining day

###"Counting Stars"###

Lately, I've been, I've been losing sleep
Dreaming about the things that we could be
But, baby, I've been, I've been praying hard
Said no more counting dollars
We'll be counting stars
Yeah, we'll be counting stars

I see this life like a swinging vine
Swing my heart across the line
In my face is flashing signs
Seek it out and ye shall find

Old but I'm not that old
Young but I'm not that bold
And I don't think the world is sold
On just doing what we're told

I feel something so right by doing the wrong thing
And I feel something so wrong by doing the right thing

I couldn't lie, couldn't lie, couldn't lie
Every thing that kills me makes me feel alive

Lately, I've been, I've been losing sleep
Dreaming about the things that we could be
But, baby, I've been, I've been praying hard
Said no more counting dollars
We'll be counting stars

Lately, I've been, I've been losing sleep
Dreaming about the things that we could be
But, baby, I've been, I've been praying hard
Said no more counting dollars
We'll be—we'll be counting stars

I feel the love
And I feel it burn
Down this river every turn
Hope is our four-letter word
Make that money, watch it burn

Old but I'm not that old
Young but I'm not that bold
And I don't think the world is sold
On just doing what we're told

And I feel something so wrong by doing the right thing
I couldn't lie, couldn't lie, couldn't lie
Every thing that drowns me makes me wanna fly

Lately, I've been, I've been losing sleep
Dreaming about the things that we could be
But, baby, I've been, I've been praying hard
Said no more counting dollars
We'll be counting stars

Lately, I've been, I've been losing sleep
Dreaming about the things that we could be
But, baby, I've been, I've been praying hard
Said no more counting dollars
We'll be—we'll be counting stars

Oh, take that money watch it burn
Sink in the river the lessons I've learned
Take that money watch it burn
Sink in the river the lessons I've learned
Take that money watch it burn
Sink in the river the lessons I've learned
Take that money watch it burn
Sink in the river the lessons I've learned

Every thing that kills me makes me feel alive

Lately, I've been, I've been losing sleep

###"You Gotta Be"###

Listen as your day unfolds,
Challenge what the future holds
Try and keep your head up to the sky
Lovers, they may cause you tears
Go ahead release your fears,
Stand up and be counted
Don't be ashamed to cry

You gotta be
You gotta be bad, you gotta be bold, you gotta be wiser
You gotta be hard, you gotta be tough, you gotta be stronger
You gotta be cool, you gotta be calm, you gotta stay together
All I know, all I know, love will save the day

Herald what your mother said
Read the books your father read
Try to solve the puzzles in your own sweet time
Some may have more cash than you
Others take a different view,
My oh my, heh, hey

You gotta be bad, you gotta be bold, you gotta be wiser
You gotta be hard, you gotta be tough, you gotta be stronger
You gotta be cool, you gotta be calm, you gotta stay together
All I know, all I know, love will save the day

Time asks no questions,
It goes on without you
Leaving you behind if you can't stand the pace
The world keeps on spinning
Can't stop it, if you try to
The best part is danger staring you in the face

Remember, listen as your day unfolds
Challenge what the future holds
Try and keep your head up to the sky
Lovers, they may cause you tears
Go ahead release your fears,
My oh my heh, hey, hey

You gotta be bad, you gotta be bold, you gotta be wiser
You gotta be hard, you gotta be tough, you gotta be stronger
You gotta be cool, you gotta be calm, you gotta stay together
All I know, all I know, love will save the day

You gotta be bad, you gotta be bold, you gotta be wiser
You gotta be hard, you gotta be tough, you gotta be stronger
You gotta be cool, you gotta be calm, you gotta stay together
All I know, all I know, love will save the day

###"Get On Your Feet"###

You say I know it's a waste of time
There's no use trying
So scared that life's gonna pass you by
Your spirit dying
Not long ago
I could feel your strenght and your devotion
What was so clear is now overcast
With mixed emotions
Deep in your heart is the answer
Find it, I know it will pull you through

Get on your feet
Get up and make it happen
Get on your feet
Stand up and take some action
Get on your feet
Don't stop before it's over
Get on your feet
The weight is off your shoulder

I think it's true that we've all been through
Some nasty weather
Let's understand that we're here
To handle things together
You gotta keep looking onto tomorrow
There's so much in life
That's meant for you

Get on your feet
Get up and make it happen
Get on your feet
Stand up and take some action
Get on your feet
Don't stop before it's over
Get on your feet
The weight is off your shoulder

###"Only The Good Die Young"###

Come out, Virginia, don't let me wait
You Catholic girls start much too late
But sooner or later it comes down to fate
I might as well be the one
They showed you a statue and told you to pray
They built you a temple and locked you away
But they never told you the price that you pay
For things that you might have done...
Only the good die young

You might have heard I run with a dangerous crowd
We ain't too pretty, we ain't too proud
We might be laughing a bit too loud
But that never hurt no one
So, come on, Virginia, show me a sign
Send up a signal I'll throw you the line
The stained-glass curtain you're hiding behind
Never lets in the sun
Darling, only the good die young

You got a nice white dress and a party on your confirmation
You got a brand new soul
And a cross of gold
But, Virginia, they didn't give you quite enough information
You didn't count on me
When you were counting on your rosary

They say there's a heaven for those who will wait
Some say it's better but I say it ain't
I'd rather laugh with the sinners than cry with the saints
The sinners are much more fun...
You know that only the good die young

You say your mother told you all that I could give you was a reputation
She never cared for me
But did she ever say a prayer for me?

Come out, come out, come out
Virginia, don't let me wait,
You Catholic girls start much too late,
But sooner or later it comes down to fate
I might as well be the one,
You know that only the good die young
Tell you baby
You know that only the good die young
Only the good die young
Only the good
Only the good die young

###"Livin' On A Prayer"###

Once upon a time not so long ago

Tommy used to work on the docks
Union's been on strike
He's down on his luck
It's tough, so tough

Gina works the diner all day
Working for her man
She brings home her pay
For love, for love

She says, "We've gotta hold on to what we've got
It doesn't make a difference if we make it or not
We've got each other and that's a lot
For love we'll give it a shot."

Whoa, we're half-way there
Whoa, livin' on a prayer
Take my hand, we'll make it. I swear
Whoa, livin' on a prayer

Tommy's got his six string in hock
Now he's holding in
What he used to make it talk
So tough, it's tough

Gina dreams of running away
When she cries in the night
Tommy whispers
"Baby, it's okay, someday

We've gotta hold on to what we've got
It doesn't make a difference if we make it or not
We've got each other and that's a lot
For love we'll give it a shot

Whoa, we're half-way there
Whoa, livin' on a prayer
Take my hand and we'll make it. I swear
Whoa, livin' on a prayer

Livin' on a prayer

We've gotta hold on ready or not
You live for the fight when it's all that you've got

Whoa, we're half-way there
Whoa, livin' on a prayer
Take my hand and we'll make it, I swear
Whoa, livin' on a prayer

Whoa, we're half-way there
Whoa, livin' on a prayer
Take my hand and we'll make it, I swear
Whoa, livin' on a prayer

###"Check Yes Juliet"###

Check yes Juliet
Are you with me?
Rain is falling down on the sidewalk
I won't go until you come outside
Check yes Juliet
Kill the limbo
I'll keep tossing rocks at your window
There's no turning back for us tonight

Lace up your shoes
Ayo ayo
Here's how we do

Run baby run
Don't ever look back
They'll tear us apart if you give them the chance
Don't sell your heart, don't say we're not meant to be
Run baby run, forever we'll be
You and me

Check yes Juliet
I'll be waiting
Wishing, wanting yours for the taking
Just sneak out and don't tell a soul goodbye
Check yes Juliet
Here's the countdown:
3, 2, 1, now fall in my arms now
They can change the locks, don't let them change your mind

Lace up your shoes
Ayo ayo
Here's how we do

Run baby run
Don't ever look back
They'll tear us apart if you give them the chance
Don't sell your heart, don't say we're not meant to be
Run baby run, forever we'll be
You and me

We're flying through the night
We're flying through the night
Way up high
The view from here is getting better with you
By my side

Run baby run
Don't ever look back
They'll tear us apart if you give them the chance
Don't sell your heart, don't say we're not meant to be
Run baby run, forever will be

Run baby run
Don't ever look back
They'll tear us apart if you give them the chance
Don't sell your heart, don't say we're not meant to be
Run baby run, forever will be
You and me
You and me
You and me

###"Man In The Mirror"###

I'm gonna make a change
For once in my life
It's gonna feel real good
Gonna make a difference
Gonna make it right

As I turn up the collar on
My favorite winter coat
This wind is blowing my mind
I see the kids in the street
With not enough to eat
Who am I to be blind
Pretending not to see their needs?

A summer's disregard
A broken bottle top
And a one man's soul
They follow each other on the wind you know
'Cause they got nowhere to go
That's why I want you to know

I'm starting with the man in the mirror
I'm asking him to change his ways
And no message could have been any clearer
If you wanna make the world a better place
Take a look at yourself and then make a change

I've been a victim of
A selfish kind of love
It's time that I realize
That there are some with no home
Not a nickel to loan
Could it be really me
Pretending that they're not alone?

A willow deeply scarred
Somebody's broken heart
And a washed-out dream
(Washed-out dream)
They follow the pattern of the wind
You see
'Cause they got no place to be
That's why I'm starting with me

I'm starting with the man in the mirror
I'm asking him to change his ways
And no message could have been any clearer
If you wanna make the world a better place
Take a look at yourself and then make a change

I'm starting with the man in the mirror
I'm asking him to change his ways
And no message could have been any clearer
If you wanna make the world a better place
Take a look at yourself and then make that change

I'm starting with the man in the mirror
I'm asking him to change his ways
('Cause you better change!)
No message could have been any clearer
If you wanna make the world a better place
Take a look at yourself and then make the change

You gotta get it right
While you got the time
'Cause when you close your heart

You can't close your your mind
(Then you close your mind!)

That man, that man, that man, that man
With that man in the mirror
(Man in the mirror, oh yeah!)
That man, that man, that man
I'm asking him to change his ways
(Better change!)
You know that man
No message could have been any clearer
If you wanna make the world a better place
Take a look at yourself and then make a change

Gonna feel real good now
Oh, no, oh, no

I'm gonna make a change
It's gonna feel real good
Shame on
Change

Just lift yourself
You know
You've got to stop it yourself
(Yeah! Make that change!)
I've gotta make that change today
(Man in the mirror)
You got to
You got to not let yourself, brother
(Yeah! Make that change!)
You know
I've got to get that man, that man
(Man in the mirror)
You've got to
You've got to move
Come on! Come on!
You got to stand up! Stand up! Stand up!
(Yeah. Make that change)
Stand up and lift yourself now
(Man in the mirror)

(Yeah. Make that change)
Gonna make that change
Come on
(Man in the mirror)

You know it
You know it
You know it
You know

Change
Make that change

###"Unwritten"###

I am unwritten, can't read my mind
I'm undefined
I'm just beginning, the pen's in my hand
Ending unplanned

Staring at the blank page before you
Open up the dirty window
Let the sun illuminate the words that you could not find

Reaching for something in the distance
So close you can almost taste it
Release your inhibitions

Feel the rain on your skin
No one else can feel it for you
Only you can let it in
No one else, no one else
Can speak the words on your lips
Drench yourself in words unspoken
Live your life with arms wide open
Today is where your book begins

The rest is still unwritten

I break tradition, sometimes my tries
Are outside the line
We've been conditioned to not make mistakes
But I can't live that way

Staring at the blank page before you
Open up the dirty window
Let the sun illuminate the words that you could not find

Reaching for something in the distance
So close you can almost taste it
Release your inhibitions

Feel the rain on your skin
No one else can feel it for you
Only you can let it in
No one else, no one else

###"Smile"###

You're better than the best
I'm lucky just to linger in your light
Cooler than the flip-side of my pillow (that's right)
Completely unaware
Nothing can compare to where you send me
It lets me know that it's okay (yeah, it's okay)
And the moments when my good times start to fade

You make me smile like the sun
Fall outta bed
Sing like a bird
Dizzy in my head
Spin like a record
Crazy on a Sunday night
You make me dance like a fool
Forget how to breathe
Shine like gold
Buzz like a bee
Just the thought of you can drive me wild
Oh, you make me smile

Even when you're gone
Somehow you come along
Just like a flower poking through the sidewalk crack
And just like that
You steal away the rain
And just like that

You make me smile like the sun
Fall outta bed
Sing like a bird
Dizzy in my head
Spin like a record
Crazy on a Sunday night
You make me dance like a fool
Forget how to breathe
Shine like gold
Buzz like a bee
Just the thought of you can drive me wild
Oh, you make me smile

Don't know how I lived without you
'Cause every time that I get around you
I see the best of me inside your eyes
You make me smile

You make me dance like a fool
Forget how to breathe
Shine like gold
Buzz like a bee
Just the thought of you can drive me wild

You make me smile like the sun
Fall outta bed
Sing like a bird
Dizzy in my head
Spin like a record
Crazy on a Sunday night
You make me dance like a fool
Forget how to breathe
Shine like gold
Buzz like a bee
Just the thought of you can drive me wild
Oh, you make me smile

(Oh, you make me smile)
Oh, you make me smile
(Oh, you make me smile)
Oh, you make me smile

###"Don't Stop"###

[Lindsey Buckingham:]
If you wake up and don't want to smile
If it takes just a little while
Open your eyes and look at the day
You'll see things in a different way

[Buckingham and C. McVie:]
Don't stop thinking about tomorrow
Don't stop, it'll soon be here
It'll be here better than before
Yesterday's gone, yesterday's gone

[Christine McVie:]
Why not think about times to come?
And not about the things that you've done?
If your life was bad to you
Just think what tomorrow will do

[Buckingham and C. McVie:]
Don't stop thinking about tomorrow
Don't stop, it'll soon be here
It'll be here better than before
Yesterday's gone, yesterday's gone

[Buckingham and C. McVie:]
All I want is to see you smile
If it takes just a little while
I know you don't believe that it's true
I never meant any harm to you

[Buckingham and C. McVie:]
Don't stop thinking about tomorrow
Don't stop, it'll soon be here
It'll be here better than before
Yesterday's gone, yesterday's gone

[Buckingham and C. McVie:]
Don't stop thinking about tomorrow
Don't stop, it'll soon be here
It'll be here better than before
Yesterday's gone, yesterday's gone

[Buckingham and C. McVie:]
Don't you look back
Don't you look back
Don't you look back
Don't you look back

###"Can't Stop The Feeling!"###

I got this feeling inside my bones
It goes electric, wavy when I turn it on
All through my city, all through my home
We're flying up, no ceiling, when we're in our zone

I got that sunshine in my pocket
Got that good soul in my feet
I feel that hot blood in my body when it drops
I can't take my eyes up off it
Moving so phenomenally
Room on lock the way we rock it
So don't stop

And under the lights when everything goes
Nowhere to hide when I'm getting you close
When we move, well, you already know
So just imagine, just imagine, just imagine

Nothing I can see but you
When you dance, dance, dance
Feeling good, good, creeping up on you
So just dance, dance, dance
Come on
All those things I shouldn't do
But you dance, dance, dance
And ain't nobody leaving soon
So keep dancing

I can't stop the feeling
So just dance, dance, dance
I can't stop the feeling
So just dance, dance, dance
Come on

Ooh, it's something magical
It's in the air, it's in my blood, it's rushing on
Don't need no reason, don't need control
I fly so high, no ceiling, when I'm in my zone

'Cause I got that sunshine in my pocket
Got that good soul in my feet
I feel that hot blood in my body when it drops
I can't take my eyes up off it
Moving so phenomenally
Room on lock the way we rock it
So don't stop

And under the lights when everything goes
Nowhere to hide when I'm getting you close
When we move, well, you already know
So just imagine, just imagine, just imagine

###"Don't Stop Me Now"###

Tonight
I'm gonna have myself a real good time
I feel alive

Yeah!
I'm floating around
In ecstasy

So don't stop me now, don't stop me
'Cause I'm having a good time, having a good time

I'm a racing car passing by
Like Lady Godiva
I'm gonna go go go
There's no stopping me

I'm a rocket ship on my way to Mars
On a collision course
I am a satellite
I'm out of control
I am a sex machine ready to reload
Like an atom bomb about to-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh explode

I'm burning through the sky
Yeah!
Two hundred degrees
That's why they call me Mister Fahrenheit
I'm traveling at the speed of light

###"Get Lucky"###

Like the legend of the Phoenix
All ends with beginnings
What keeps the planets spinning (uh)
The force from the beginning

(Look)

We've come too far to give up who we are
So let's raise the bar and our cups to the stars

She's up all night to the sun

Straight into my heart and stole it
Through the doors and passed the guards (wow)

###"Geronimo"###

Can you feel it?
Now it's coming back
We can steal it.
If we bridge this gap,
I can see you
Through the curtains of the waterfall.

When I lost it,
Yeah you held my hand,
But I tossed it,
Didn't understand,
You were waiting,
As I dove into the waterfall.

So say Geronimo!
Say Geronimo!
Say Geronimo!
Say Geronimo!
Say Geronimo!
Say Geronimo!
Say Geronimo!

Can you feel my love?
Bombs away,
Bombs away,
Bombs away.
Can you feel my love?
Bombs away,
Bombs away,
Bombs away,
Say Geronimo!

Well we rushed it,
Moving way too fast.
That we crushed it,
But it's in the past.
We can make this leap,
Through the curtains of the waterfall.

So Say Geronimo!
Say Geronimo!
Say Geronimo!
Say Geronimo!
Say Geronimo!
Say Geronimo!
Say Geronimo!

Can you feel my love?
Bombs away,
Bombs away,
Bombs away.
Can you feel my love?
Bombs away,
Bombs away,
Bombs away.

Well I'm just a boy,
With a broken toy,
All lost and coy,
At the curtains of the waterfall.
So it's here I stand,
As a broken man,
But I've found my friend,
At the curtains of the waterfall.

Now I'm falling down,
Through the crashing sound.
And you've come around,
At the curtains of the waterfall.

And you rushed to me,
And it sets us free.
So I fall to my knees,
At the curtains of the waterfall.

So Say Geronimo!
Say Geronimo!
Say Geronimo!
Say Geronimo!
Say Geronimo!
Say Geronimo!
Say Geronimo!

Can you feel (Say Geronimo! [x4]) my love?

Can you feel my love?

###"New Attitude"###

Running hot
Running cold
I was running into overload
That was extreme

I took it so high, so low, so long
There was no where to go like a bad dream

[Bridge:]
Somehow that wires uncrossed
The table were turned
Never knew I had such a lesson to learn

[Chorus:]
I'm feeling good from my hat to my shoe
Know where I am going and I know what to do
I've tidied up my point of view
I've got a new attitude
I'm in control
My worries are few
'Cause I got love like I never knew
Ooo, ooo, ooo, ooo
I've got a new attitude

I am wearing a new dress, a new hat
Brand new ideas
As a matter of fact
I've changed for good

Must have been the cold nights, new moon
Night changes
Or forget your love for just being like I should

[Bridge]

[Chorus]

Ooo, Ooo, Oooo

[Bridge]

[Chorus]

###"Home"###

###"Fight Song"###

Like a small boat
On the ocean
Sending big waves
Into motion
Like how a single word
Can make a heart open
I might only have one match
But I can make an explosion

And all those things I didn't say
Wrecking balls inside my brain
I will scream them loud tonight
Can you hear my voice this time?

This is my fight song
Take back my life song
Prove I'm alright song
My power's turned on
Starting right now I'll be strong
I'll play my fight song
And I don't really care if nobody else believes
'Cause I've still got a lot of fight left in me

Losing friends and I'm chasing sleep
Everybody's worried about me
In too deep
Say I'm in too deep (in too deep)
And it's been two years
I miss my home
But there's a fire burning in my bones
Still believe
Yeah, I still believe

And all those things I didn't say
Wrecking balls inside my brain
I will scream them loud tonight
Can you hear my voice this time?

This is my fight song
Take back my life song
Prove I'm alright song
My power's turned on
Starting right now I'll be strong
I'll play my fight song
And I don't really care if nobody else believes
'Cause I've still got a lot of fight left in me

A lot of fight left in me

Like a small boat
On the ocean
Sending big waves
Into motion
Like how a single word
Can make a heart open
I might only have one match
But I can make an explosion

This is my fight song (Hey!)
Take back my life song (Hey!)
Prove I'm alright song (Hey!)
My power's turned on
Starting right now I'll be strong (I'll be strong)
I'll play my fight song
And I don't really care if nobody else believes
'Cause I've still got a lot of fight left in me

No I've still got a lot of fight left in me

###"I Will Survive"###

At first I was afraid, I was petrified
Kept thinking I could never live without you by my side
But then I spent so many nights thinking how you did me wrong
And I grew strong, and I learned how to get along

And so you're back from outer space
I just walked in to find you here with that sad look upon your face
I should have changed that stupid lock
I should have made you leave your key
If I'd have known for just one second you'd be back to bother me

Go on now, go. Walk out the door
Just turn around now 'cause you're not welcome anymore
Weren't you the one who tried to hurt me with goodbye?
Did you think I'd crumble?
Did you think I'd lay down and die?

Oh, no, not I
I will survive
Oh, as long as I know how to love I know I'll stay alive
I've got all my life to live
I've got all my love to give
And I'll survive
I will survive, hey, hey

It took all the strength I had not to fall apart
Kept trying hard to mend the pieces of my broken heart
And I spent, oh, so many nights just feeling sorry for myself
I used to cry but now I hold my head up high

And you see me somebody new
I'm not that chained-up little person still in love with you
And so you felt like dropping in
And just expect me to be free
And now I'm saving all my loving for someone who's loving me

Go on now, go. Walk out the door
Just turn around now 'cause you're not welcome anymore
Weren't you the one who tried to break me with goodbye?
Did you think I'd crumble?
Did you think I'd lay down and die?
Oh, no, not I
I will survive
Oh, as long as I know how to love I know I'll stay alive
I've got all my life to live
I've got all my love to give
And I'll survive
I will survive

Go on now, go. Walk out the door
Just turn around now 'cause you're not welcome anymore
Weren't you the one who tried to break me with goodbye?
Did you think I'd crumble?
Did you think I'd lay down and die?
Oh, no, not I
I will survive
Oh, as long as I know how to love I know I'll stay alive
I've got all my life to live
I've got all my love to give
And I'll survive
I will survive
I will survive

###"I Believe I Can Fly"###

I used to think that I could not go on
And life was nothing but an awful song
But now I know the meaning of true love
I'm leaning on the everlasting arms

If I can see it, then I can do it
If I just believe it, there's nothing to it

[Chorus:]
I believe I can fly
I believe I can touch the sky
I think about it every night and day
Spread my wings and fly away
I believe I can soar
I see me running through that open door
I believe I can fly
I believe I can fly
I believe I can fly

See I was on the verge of breaking down
Sometimes silence can seem so loud
There are miracles in life I must achieve
But first I know it starts inside of me, oh

If I can see it, then I can be it
If I just believe it, there's nothing to it

[Chorus]

Hey, cause I believe in me, oh

If I can see it, then I can do it (I can do it)
If I just believe it, there's nothing to it

[Chorus]

Hey, if I just spread my wings
I can fly
I can fly
I can fly, hey
If I just spread my wings
I can fly-eye-eye-eye
Hum, fly-eye-eye

###"Good Life"###

I'm stumbling over my laces
Kaleidoscope of everyone's faces
All my friends are saying, "Come on, Rachel, you should sit."
But God, this music feels so good, I do the opposite

How 'bout we stay and never go home
And be in the present and break all our phones
I just wanna stay the side of your stream of consciousness
No, I don't wanna over-think it or I'll ruin it

Don't gotta be afraid of those ghosts
Angels on my shoulder, I know
If I stay in the moment and be right here, right now
'Cause I know

I'm living when I feel like this
I'm living when I open my eyes
And ooh, I got the good girl vibes
'Cause I, 'cause I, 'cause I, I suddenly realize

I'm living when my heart reacts
I see the colors in the sunrise
And ooh, I got the good girl vibes
'Cause I, 'cause I, 'cause I, 'cause I got a good life

And every stranger in the car
Has a private concert right where they are
I just wanna kiss the whole world and hug all the planets
It's like I'm onto something big when I don't over-plan it

Don't gotta be afraid of old ghosts
Devil's on my shoulder, he's gone home
If I stay in the moment and be right here, right now
'Cause I know

I'm living when I feel like this
I'm living when I open my eyes
And ooh, I got the good girl vibes
'Cause I, 'cause I, 'cause I, I suddenly realize

I'm living when my heart reacts
I see the colors in the sunrise
And ooh, I got the good girl vibes
'Cause I, 'cause I, 'cause I, 'cause I got a good life

And there's so much love (Do you feel it?)
So much love ('Cause I feel it)
There's so much love
I'm living when I finally realize I got a good life

I'm really like the luckiest person in the world in the smallest ways 'cause I get to make music, I get to make music.
Every day, no matter who's listening, no matter what it sounds like, no matter if no one hears the debut I made that day I get to move molecules around in space, that's crazy.
And even when it's scary and it's terrifying, and my inner child in the sandlot gets her sand castle kicked over, I'm still building, I'm still learning 'cause I'm growing, I'm breathing, and I'm living.

Don't gotta be afraid of old ghosts
Devil's on my shoulder, he's gone home
If I stay in the moment and be right here, right now
'Cause I know

I'm living when I feel like this
I'm living when I open my eyes
And ooh, I got the good girl vibes
'Cause I, 'cause I, 'cause I, I suddenly realize
I'm living when my heart reacts
I see the colors in the sunrise
And ooh, I got the good girl vibes
'Cause I, 'cause I, 'cause I, 'cause I got a good life

And there's so much love (Do you feel it?)
So much love ('Cause I feel it)
There's so much love
I'm living when I finally realize I got a good life
And there's so much love (Do you feel it?)
There's just so much love ('Cause I feel it)
There's just so much, so much love
I'm living when I finally realize I got a good life

###"America's Sweetheart"###

No, there ain't nothing that I gotta prove
You think your words will make me black and blue, but I
I think I'm pretty with these old boots on
I think it's funny when I drink too much, hey
You tryna change me, you can go to hell
Cause I don't wanna be nobody else
I like the chip I got in my front teeth
And I got bad tattoos you won't believe

So kick out the jams, kick up the soul
Pour another glass of that rock and roll
Turn up the band, fire in the hole
Gonna lose control tonight

What do you want from me
I'm not America's sweetheart
So beat the drum with me
I'm not America's sweetheart
Well, they say I'm too loud
For this town
So I lit a match
And burned it down
What do you want from me
I'm not America's sweetheart
But you love me anyway

My hands are dirty and my heart is cold
Them boys I've been with say I got no soul, when I
I need another honey at the bar
I'll think it's funny when I break his heart
My kind of medicine is whiskey straight
I got a mouth to put you in your place, and they
They said I'll never be the poster type
But they don't make posters of my kind of life

So kick out the jams, kick up the soul
Pour another glass of that rock and roll
Turn up the band, fire in the hole
Gonna lose control tonight

What do you want from me
I'm not America's sweetheart
So beat the drum with me
I'm not America's sweetheart
Well, they say I'm too loud
For this town
So I lit a match
And burned it down
What do you want from me
I'm not America's sweetheart
But you love me anyway

You love me anyway
You love me anyway

Kick out the jams, kick up the soul
Pour another glass of that rock and roll
Turn up the band, fire in the hole
Holler if you ready, gonna lose control
Kick out the jams, kick up the soul
Pour another glass of that rock and roll
Turn up the band, fire in the hole
Gonna lose control tonight

What do you want from me
I'm not America's sweetheart
So beat the drum with me
I'm not America's sweetheart
Well, they say I'm too loud
For this town
So I lit a match
And burned it down
What do you want from me
I'm not America's sweetheart
But you love me anyway

You love me anyway
You love me anyway

I'm not America's sweetheart

###"Girls Just Want To Have Fun"###

I come home in the morning light
My mother says, "When you gonna live your life right?"
Oh, mamma, dear, we're not the fortunate ones
And girls—they wanna have fun
Oh, girls just wanna have fun

The phone rings in the middle of the night
My father yells, "What you gonna do with your life?"
Oh, daddy, dear, you know you're still number one
But girls—they wanna have fun
Oh, girls just wanna have

That's all they really want
Some fun
When the working day is done
Oh, girls—they wanna have fun
Oh, girls just wanna have fun

Girls—they wanna
Wanna have fun
Girls wanna have

Some boys take a beautiful girl
And hide her away from the rest of the world
I wanna be the one to walk in the sun
Oh girls they wanna have fun
Oh girls just wanna have

That's all they really want
Some fun
When the working day is done
Oh, girls—they wanna have fun

###"Unbreakable Smile"###

La da da da dee, you're not breaking me
La de da da da da da da da, yeah

Somebody told me fame is a disease
You start singing the blues when you start seeing the green
But I think it's all about what you choose
The way you live your life, depends on you
That's when I realized I wanna make a difference
Change other people's lives, give hope, even for a moment
Use my name for good and change the game I could
Because to make it you think I gotta act a certain way,
Be a little bit insane, live a little, it's okay
I guess we have different definitions of living, but you'll twist my words anyway
You'll say that I'm naïve, like I don't have a past,
You're the one being deceived, I see right behind the mask
Tryna stir me up and get me mad
I smile because happiness is all I have, so

La da da da dee, you're not breaking me
La de da da da, ain't got time for ya, singing
La da da da dee, you won't shatter me
La de da da da, got an unbreakable smile

You see me hanging with my fam, but that don't mean I'm living in a bubble
You'll find me at church, but that don't mean I can't cause trouble
Stir up a little scene 'cause isn't that what you want?
For me to mess up, so you can dress up some story
Saying, Tori this'll sell more records
But I'd rather make 'em yawn than be a pawn on your chessboard
So call me boring, call me cookie cutter
Call me what you want
A matter of fact
Just say it loud and don't st-stutter
'Cause I know who I am, yeah I'm still the same
Just a California girl with big dreams
Thinking maybe they'll let me sing songs about real things
And baby who knows maybe I can sell out shows without taking off my clothes
God made me sexy I don't care if only I know

La da da da dee, you're not breaking me
La de da da da, ain't got time for ya, singing
La da da da dee, you won't shatter me
La de da da da, got an unbreakable smile

And I'll just keep on singing.

La da da da dee, you're not breaking me
La de da da da, ain't got time for ya
La da da da dee, you won't shatter me
La de da da da, got an unbreakable smile

I might be smiling, yes
But don't mistake kindness for weakness

And so don't ever take for granted what the spirit has given you
In the first verse
You might never get a second verse
This ain't rehearsal, you can't put it in reverse
So just believe in yourself
Don't let nobody bein' negative, tell you what to do 
Cause I know (cause I know)
In this sweet sweet life
That just this much is true

###"The Champion"###

[Carrie Underwood:]
I'll be the last one standing
Two hands in the air, I'm a champion
You'll be looking up at me when it's over
I live for the battle, I'm a soldier, yeah

I'm a fighter like Rocky
Put you flat on your back like Ali
Yeah, I'm the greatest, I'm stronger
Paid my dues, can't lose, Imma own ya, ay

I've been working my whole life
And now it's do or die

I am invincible, unbreakable
Unstoppable, unshakable
They knock me down, I get up again
I am the champion
You're gonna know my name
You can't hurt me now
I can't feel the pain
I was made for this, yeah, I was born to win
I am the champion

When they write my story
They're gonna say that I did it for the glory
But don't think that I did it for the fame, yeah
I did it for the love of the game, yeah
And this is my chance I'm taking
All them old records I'm breaking
All you people watching on the TV
You go ahead and put your bets on me, ay

I've been waiting my whole life
To see my name in lights

I am invincible, unbreakable
Unstoppable, unshakable
They knock me down, I get up again
I am the champion
You're gonna know my name
You can't hurt me now
I can't feel the pain
I was made for this, yeah, I was born to win

[Ludacris:]
Born champion, Luda!
The C is for the courage I possess through the drama
H is for the hurt but it's all for the honor
A is for my attitude working through the patience
Money comes and goes so the M is for motivation
Gotta stay consistent, the P is to persevere
The I is for integrity, innovative career
The O is optimistic, open and never shut
And the N is necessary cause I'm never giving up
See they ask me how I did it, I just did it from the heart
Crushing the competition, been doing it from the start
They say that every champion is all about his principles
Carrie!

I am the champion

###"Fire N Gold"###

Like an astronaut that's scared of heights
With a heart that's beating at the speed of light
You've been waiting for this feeling all your life
Sometimes it's just hard to realize

When you're stuck in a moment
And your spark has been stolen
This is our time to own it
So own it

Baby, we were born with
Fire and gold in our eyes, eyes
With fire and gold in our eyes, eyes
Got lightning in a bottle
Hands on the throttle
Even in the dust we shine
With fire and gold in our eyes

There is something different about you and I (about you and I)
And I feel like I have known you my whole life
There is beauty behind every tear you've cried
Sometimes it's just hard to realize

When you're stuck in a moment
And your spark has been stolen
This is our time to own it
So own it

Baby, we were born with
Fire and gold in our eyes, eyes
With fire and gold in our eyes, eyes
Got lightning in a bottle
Hands on the throttle
Even in the dust we shine
With fire and gold in our eyes

There is love inside this madness
We are walking on the moon
Though I don't believe in magic
I believe in me and you

I believe in me and you
I believe in me and you

Baby, we were born with
Fire and gold in our eyes, eyes
With fire and gold in our eyes, eyes
Got lightning in a bottle
Hands on the throttle
Even in the dust we shine
With fire and gold in our eyes

###"Get Along"###

Met a man wearin' a t-shirt, says "Virginia is for lovers"
Had a Bible in his left hand and a bottle in the other
He says "All you're really given is the sunshine and your name"
We both started laughin' when the sky started to rain

Get along, on down the road
We've got a long long way to go
Scared to live, scared to die
We ain't perfect but we try

Get along while we can
Always give love the upper hand
Paint a wall, learn to dance
Call your mom, buy a boat
Drink a beer, sing a song
Make a friend, can't we all get along

Saw a model on a billboard, 1-800 get to know me
Wondered was she photoshopped, or were her eyes really that lonely?
Did she leave her hometown thinkin' she'd end up in L.A.?
Did she break down in the desert and get stuck beside the highway?

Get along, on down the road
We've got a long long way to go
Scared to live, scared to die
We ain't perfect but we try

Get along while we can
Always give love the upper hand
Paint a wall, learn to dance
Call your mom, buy a boat
Drink a beer, sing a song
Make a friend, can't we all get along

We find out when you die the keys to heaven can't be bought
We still don't know what love is but we sure know what it's not
Sometimes you got to

Get along, on down the road
We've got a long long way to go
Scared to live, scared to die
We ain't perfect but we try

Get along while we can
Always give love the upper hand
Paint a wall, learn to dance
Call your mom, buy a boat
Drink a beer, sing a song
Make a friend, can't we all get along

###"Run Away"###

Take a breath
Take a break for a minute
Now I've gotta figure this out
I'm sick of fools
Sick of losers still winning
I get so turned around

The other shoe dropped
When I drew the last straw
Then the camels back broke
And I'm done pretending
Nothing can get me down
I'm a little unwell
Like I'm not myself
And I need another joke
Like I need a heat stroke
Gotta get out somehow

We can run away
We can take flight
We don't need a reason
We can ride all night
Don't worry the world won't break
Don't worry just make your escape
We can disappear
Fade into the starlight
Never looking back
Somehow its all right
Don't worry I don't care what they say
We can run
We can run
We can run away

I've always heard not to hide from the hard times
Maybe I should take it head on
What's the use when its crooked by design
Oh, I'd rather not be a pawn

The other shoe dropped
When I drew the last straw
Then the camels back broke
And I'm done pretending
Nothing can get me down
I'm a little unwell
Like I'm not myself
And I need another joke
Like I need a heat stroke
Save me before I drown

We can run away
We can take flight
We don't need a reason
We can ride all night
Don't worry the world won't break
Don't worry just make your escape
We can disappear
Fade into the starlight
Never looking back
Somehow its all right
Don't worry I don't care what they say
We can run
We can run
We can run away

Baby nothing can stop us
We can build our own metropolis
We got everything that we need
We can live a fantasy
Baby nothing can stop us
We can build our own metropolis
We got everything that we need
We can live a fantasy

We can run
We can run
We can run

We can run away
We can take flight
We don't need a reason
We can ride all night
Don't worry the world won't break
Don't worry just make your escape
We can disappear
Fade into the starlight

We got everything that we need
We can live a fantasy
Baby nothing can stop us
We can build our own metropolis
We got everything that we need
We can live a fantasy

Doesn't matter where you wanna go
I can take you there just let me know
Doesn't matter where you wanna go
I can take you there
I'll give you everything just say the word
I'll spend my every breath to let you learn
I'll give you everything just say the word
I can take you there

###"Me Without You"###

Raindrops rollin' off my brim
Streetlights got the pavement glistenin'
Touchdown, I fall into Your arms
Right where I belong
Your everlasting arms

And where would I be
Without You...

I'd be packin' my bags when I need to stay
I'd be chasin' every breeze that blows my way
I'd be building my kingdom just to watch it fade away
It's true
That's me without You-ou-ou-ou-ou-ou
That's me without You-ou-ou-ou-ou-ou
That's me without You-ou-ou-ou-ou-ou
Don't know where I'd be without You
(Wooooah, without you)

Flashback, step into the scene
There's You and there's a very different me
Touchdown, You had me at believe
You had me at believe, You did

And where would I be
Without You, without You...

I'd be packin' my bags when I need to stay
I'd be chasin' every breeze that blows my way
I'd be building my kingdom just to watch it fade away
It's true
That's me without You-ou-ou-ou-ou-ou
That's me without You-ou-ou-ou-ou-ou
That's me without You-ou-ou-ou-ou-ou
Don't know where I'd be without You

(Where would I be...)

[WHISPERING]
(I was so deep,
So incomplete
Til' You rescued me
Yeah, You rescued me)

You rescued me
You are mine, I am Yours
You rescued me
And I am Yours forever
You saved me, remade me

And where would I be

I'd be packin' my bags when I need to stay
I'd be chasin' every breeze that blows my way
I'd be building my kingdom just to watch it fade away
It's true
That I'd be packin' my bags when I need to stay
I'd be chasin' every breeze that blows my way
I'd be building my kingdom just to watch it fade away
So true
That's me without You-ou-ou-ou-ou-ou
That's me without You-ou-ou-ou-ou-ou
That's me without You-ou-ou-ou-ou-ou
Don't know where I'd be without You

That's me without You-ou-ou-ou
That's me without You-ou-ou-ou
That's me without You-ou-ou-ou
Don't know where I'd be without You

###"Hello, You Beautiful Thing"###

Fall out of bed and catch a fading star
Fancy, I woke up before my alarm
Rub my mind through my eyes, it's the best I can do
Before it's automatic habit of returning to you
Though I smile when it happens almost as if it was magic
It means there's a God somewhere and He's laughing
And I shuffle my slipper-less toes to the kitchen
Still low to the ground, but high on living

And I know, I know, it's gonna be a good day
Hello, hello, you beautiful thing

Waking up, I stretch my body and acknowledge some aches
It must be something I did yesterday
Pour a cup of liquid gold, because my engine's still cold
But in a minute everything's gonna change

'Cause I know, I know, it's gonna be a good day
Hello, hello, you beautiful thing
Hello, hello, you beautiful thing

And this is what I've been waiting for
(This is what I've been waiting for)
This is what I've been waiting for
(This is what I've been waiting for)

Looking out from a cul-de-sac watching the bend
Of the Earth take the black of the night from the dirt
I can see from the depths of my readjusting eyes
A reflection of yes's and that ever-changing sky
But why do bad dreams linger long after I awake
I don't need no scenes of violence or pain replayed
And I feel quite foolish sometimes when I pray
But my thoughts are all I got so I try to make 'em brave

And I know, I know, it's gonna be a good day
Hello, hello, you beautiful thing
Hello, hello, you beautiful thing

Oh this is what I've been waiting for
(This is what I've been waiting for)
Oh this is what I've been waiting for
(This is what I've been waiting for)
Oh this is what I've been waiting for
(This is what I've been waiting for)
Oh this is what I've been waiting for
(Hello)

And I know, I know, it's gonna be a good day
Hello, hello, you beautiful thing

###"Have It All"###

May you have auspiciousness and causes of success
May you have the confidence to always do your best
May it take no effort in you being generous
Sharing what you can, nothing more, nothing less

May you know the meaning of the word "happiness"
May you always lead from the beating in your chest
May you be treated like an esteemed guest
May you get to rest, may you catch your breath

###"I'm Still Standing"###

You could never know what it's like
Your blood like winter freezes just like ice
And there's a cold lonely light that shines from you
You'll wind up like the wreck you hide behind that mask you use

And did you think this fool could never win
Well, look at me, I'm a-coming back again
I got a taste of love in a simple way
And if you need to know while I'm still standing you just fade away

Don't you know I'm still standing better than I ever did
Looking like a true survivor, feeling like a little kid
And I'm still standing after all this time
Picking up the pieces of my life without you on my mind

I'm still standing. Yeah, yeah, yeah
I'm still standing. Yeah, yeah, yeah

Once I never could hope to win
You're starting down the road leaving me again
The threats you made were meant to cut me down
And if our love was just a circus you'd be a clown by now

You know I'm still standing better than I ever did
Looking like a true survivor, feeling like a little kid
I'm still standing after all this time
Picking up the pieces of my life without you on my mind

I'm still standing. Yeah, yeah, yeah
I'm still standing. Yeah, yeah, yeah

Don't you know that I'm still standing better than I ever did
Looking like a true survivor, feeling like a little kid
And I'm still standing after all this time
Picking up the pieces of my life without you on my mind

I'm still standing. Yeah, yeah, yeah
I'm still standing. Yeah, yeah, yeah

I'm still standing. Yeah, yeah, yeah
I'm still standing. Yeah, yeah, yeah

I'm still standing. Yeah, yeah, yeah
I'm still standing. Yeah, yeah, yeah

###"Dog Days Are Over"###

Happiness hit her like a train on a track
Coming towards her stuck still no turning back

She hid around corners and she hid under beds
She killed it with kisses and from it, she fled
With every bubble, she sank with a drink
And washed it away down the kitchen sink

The dog days are over
The dog days are done
The horses are coming
So you better run

Run fast for your mother, run fast for your father
Run for your children, for your sisters and brothers
Leave all your love and your longing behind
You can't carry it with you if you want to survive

The dog days are over
The dog days are done
Can you hear the horses?
'Cause here they come

And I never wanted anything from you
Except everything you had and what was left after that too, oh
Happiness hit her like a bullet in the back
Struck from a great height by someone who should know better than that

The dog days are over
The dog days are done
Can you hear the horses?
'Cause here they come

Run fast for your mother, run fast for your father
Run for your children, for your sisters and brothers
Leave all your love and your longing behind
You can't carry it with you if you want to survive

The dog days are over
The dog days are done
Can you hear the horses?
'Cause here they come

The dog days are over
The dog days are done
The horses are coming
So you better run
The dog days are over
The dog days are done
The horses are coming
So you better run

###"Good Vibes"###

I ain't watchin' TV today
Bad news, it can just stay away
If you ain't got anything good to say
Then shut your mouth

I got my windows down and my blinders on
Radio set to my favorite song
All green lights on the road I'm on
And there's ain't no doubt

I'm gettin' them good vibes
I'm livin' this good life
I'm breathin' on God's time
And I ain't gonna waste one breath
I'm soakin' it all up
I got me a full cup
And there ain't nothing spill it
Nothin' gonna kill it
Wavin' them worries goodbye
I'm feelin' them good vibes

I ain't tryna hear the negative (nope)
I'm just tryna change the narrative
Hell, it's simply imperative
And we all have a damn good time

I'm gettin' them good vibes
I'm livin' this good life
I'm breathin' on God's time
And I ain't gonna waste one breath
I'm soakin' it all up
I got me a full cup
And there ain't nothing spill it
Nothin' gonna kill it
Wavin' them worries goodbye
I'm feelin' them good vibes

I gotta good girl, she got a good smile
I kiss her good morning, I kiss her goodnight
We keep it on the up, that's how we get down
So don't be comin' around
Unless you got them good vibes

I'm livin' this good life
I'm breathin' on God's time
And I ain't gonna waste one breath
I'm soakin' it all up
I got me a full cup
And there ain't nothing spill it
Nothin' gonna kill it
Wavin' them worries goodbye

I'm feelin' them good vibes
I'm breathin' on God's time
And I ain't gonna waste one breath
I'm soakin' it all up
I got me a full cup
And there ain't nothing spill it
Nothin' gonna kill it
Wavin' them worries goodbye
I'm feelin' them good vibes
Oh I'm feelin' them good vibes
Yeah

###"High Hopes"###

(High, high hopes)

Had to have high, high hopes for a living
Shooting for the stars when I couldn't make a killing
Didn't have a dime but I always had a vision
Always had high, high hopes
(High, high hopes)

Had to have high, high hopes for a living
Didn't know how but I always had a feeling
I was gonna be that one in a million
Always had high, high hopes

Mama said
Fulfill the prophecy
Be something greater
Go make a legacy
Manifest destiny
Back in the days
We wanted everything
Wanted everything 
(High, high hopes)

Mama said
Burn your biographies
Rewrite your history
Light up your wildest dreams
Museum victories, every day
We wanted everything, wanted everything

Mama said, don't give up, it's a little complicated
All tied up, no more love and I'd hate to see you waiting

Had to have high, high hopes for a living
Shooting for the stars when I couldn't make a killing
Didn't have a dime but I always had a vision

Didn't know how but I always had a feeling
I was gonna be that one in a million
Always had high, high hopes

Mama said
It's uphill for oddities
Stranger crusaders
Ain't ever wannabes
The weird and the novelties
Don't ever change
We wanted everything, wanted everything
(High, high hopes)

Stay up on that rise
Stay up on that rise and never come down, oh
Stay up on that rise
Stay up on that rise and never come down

Mama said, don't give up, it's a little complicated
All tied up, no more love and I'd hate to see you waiting
They say it's all been done but they haven't seen the best of me-e-e-e
So I got one more run and it's gonna be a sight to see-e-e-e

Had to have high, high hopes for a living
Shooting for the stars when I couldn't make a killing
Didn't have a dime but I always had a vision

###"Hey Look Ma, I Made It"###

All my life been hustling and tonight is my appraisal
'Cause I'm a hooker selling songs and my pimp's a record label
This world is full of demons, stocks, and bonds, and bible traders
So I do the deed, get up and leave, a climber and a sadist, yeah

Are you ready for the sequel?
Ain't ready for the latest?
In the garden of evil
I'm gonna be the greatest
In a golden cathedral
I'll be praying for the faithless
And if you lose, boo hoo

Hey look Ma, I made it
Hey look Ma, I made it
Everything's comin' up aces, aces
And if it's a dream, don't wake me, don't wake me
I said hey look Ma, I made it

Friends are happy for me, or they're honeysuckle phonies
Then they celebrate my medals or they wanna take my trophies
Some are loyal soldiers while these other thorns are rosy
And if you never know who you can trust then trust me, you'll be lonely, oh

Are you ready for the sequel?

And if it's a dream, don't wake me, don't wake me

I said hey look Ma, I made it
(Mama best believe it)
(Mama best believe it) Hey look Ma, I made it
(Think I must be dreamin')
(Wide awake and dreaming) Hey look Ma, I made it
(Mama best believe it)
(Mama best believe it) Hey look Ma, I made it
(Think I must be dreamin')
Hey look Ma, I made it
